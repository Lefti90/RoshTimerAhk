# RoshTimerAhk
Roshan timer with AHK 2.0

Usage:
Type ;;rs and then type time of Roshan's death.
eg. ;;rs 32:53
This prints:
"32:53 Aegis: 37:53 Early: 40:53 Late: 43:53"

if we cross the magical 100 minute mark, don't use colons.
eg. ;;rs 10053 prints:
"10053 Aegis: 105:53 Early: 108:53 Late: 111:53"
